				<div class="aboutMeText">
					<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
						My name is Sherry, and I am a sophomore at Penn State University studying Computer Science 
						and minoring in Mathematics and Cybersecurity Computational Foundations. Some of my interests 
						that I am exploring include full-stack development, cybersecurity, and machine learning. 
					</p>
					<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
						My interest in full-stack development stemmed from my younger self wanting a personal website. 
						Although my current website is static and mainly features HTML and CSS, I am learning JavaScript 
						and different frameworks and libraries, such as React, Node, and Express, to make it more dynamic 
						in the future. Next, my interest in cybersecurity developed after an unfortunate event where my 
						debit card got hacked back in high school. Last, machine learning is something I recently got into 
						after reading a journal paper last year on a reinforcement learning algorithm developed by CalTech 
						to run on underwater drones. 
					</p>
					<p>
						During my free time, you can find me exploring new parts of the city, hiking in the mountains, eating 
						spicy salmon poke bowls, or watching Star Wars. Most importantly, I enjoy spending time with my friends 
						and family. I also play the violin. I have over eleven years of experience with the instrument, and I 
						used to play for the San Jose Youth Symphony Philharmonic Orchestra back home. The summer after my 
						sophomore year in high school, I had the opportunity to travel to Argentina and Uruguay with my orchestra 
						and perform in several beautiful venues, including the magnificent Teatro Col√≥n.
